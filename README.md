## PyRamen

Welcome to Ichiban Ramen!

Opening a ramen shop has always been my dream, and now it's finally been realised–– I'm closing out on my second year of sales! Like last year, I need to analyse my business's financial performance by cross-referencing my sales data with my internal menu data to figure out revenues and costs for the year.

This year, I also want to analyse how well my business did on a per-product basis (as I have several choices of ramen) in order to better understand which products are doing well, which are doing poorly, and, ultimately, which products may need to be removed or changed.

Therefore, I need to innovate. With more customers and more data to process, I'll need a tool that will allow me to automate my calculations in a manner that scales with my business.

Enter Python! Python provides a wide range of capabilities for handling data, harnessing the power of low-level Python data structures and high-level development libraries, all the while supporting the automation and scalability needs for a growing enterprise.
